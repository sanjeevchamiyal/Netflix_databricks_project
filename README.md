# Netflix Data Engineering Pipeline

##Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Unity Catalog, following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold). The pipeline efficiently ingests, processes, and transforms Netflix dataset files from GitHub into a structured Delta Lakehouse.

##Technology Stack
Cloud: Microsoft Azure
Data Ingestion: Azure Data Factory (ADF)
Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)
Processing & Transformation: Databricks (PySpark, Delta Live Tables)
Data Governance: Databricks Unity Catalog
Streaming: Databricks Autoloader
File Format: CSV, Delta


##Project Architecture
The project follows the Medallion Architecture to handle structured data efficiently:

Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)

Azure Data Factory (ADF) loads Netflix dataset from GitHub to the Bronze Layer in ADLS.
Databricks Autoloader is used for streaming data from the Landing Page in ADLS to the Bronze Layer.
Silver Layer (Data Cleansing & Transformation)

Cleaned and transformed raw data.
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
Stored as Delta tables for optimized querying.
Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)

Created Delta Live Tables (DLT) for real-time, high-quality analytics.
Stored aggregated, business-friendly data ready for visualization and reporting.
